# Stryker Football Robot ‚öΩü§ñ

**Stryker** is a custom-built, omni-directional football-playing robot designed for a RoboCup-style competition. The robot was engineered for agility, precision, and competitive control in small-field robot soccer matches.

## üîß Features
- **Mecanum wheels** for full 360¬∞ movement
- **Dual servo-powered arms** for ball handling
- **Solenoid kicker** for high-speed shooting
- **Custom PCB** and robust chassis design
- **NRF24L01** wireless communication module
- Microcontroller-based control and real-time response
